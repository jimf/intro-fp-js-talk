# Intro to Functional Programming in JavaScript Talk

[Slides][slides]

This repo contains resources for my [Bucks County JS][BucksCoJS] intro to
functional programming in JavaScript, including the code used for the
[Ramda mug][] giveaway where I use [Ramda][] and [data.task][] to call out
to the [Meetup API][] to select a winner in a pure and functional way.

To run the code (tested with Node.js v5):

    $ npm install
    $ node ./index.js

To learn more about `data.task` specifically, see my brain dump on the library
[here](https://github.com/jimf/fp-cheetsheet/blob/master/promises-as-futures.md)
where I compare its usage with that of ES6 promises.

The React code that we looked at can be found [here](https://github.com/jimf/http-decision-tree).
